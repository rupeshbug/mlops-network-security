## Phishing Detection MLOps Pipeline

An end-to-end **MLOps pipeline** for detecting phishing websites using classical machine learning.  
The project covers the full lifecycle: **data ingestion → validation → transformation → model training → tracking → packaging → deployment on AWS** with an inference API built using **FastAPI**.

### 🌐 Live Demo

The application is deployed on AWS EC2 and exposed via FastAPI.

> Note: The service is hosted on AWS free-tier resources and may be stopped in the future.

### 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds a production-ready ML workflow to classify websites as **phishing** or **legitimate** based on handcrafted URL, domain, and JavaScript-related features.  
The solution follows real-world MLOps practices including:

- Automated pipeline orchestration  
- Reproducible experimentation with MLflow  
- Versioned datasets and artifacts  
- Docker containerization  
- Cloud deployment on AWS  
- API-based model inference  

**Dataset**: The dataset used for training is located at Network_Data/phisingData.csv and contains handcrafted features extracted from website URLs and metadata.

### 📌 Problem Statement

Phishing websites are one of the most common cybersecurity threats.  
Given a dataset of website features (URL structure, domain age, JavaScript flags, etc.), the goal is to:

> **Build and deploy a model that classifies websites as phishing (0) or legitimate (1).**

This project demonstrates how such a system can be built using proper MLOps principles.

### 🧠 Key Features

- ✔️ End-to-end ML pipeline (training + prediction)
- ✔️ Modular architecture with clean component design  
- ✔️ MLflow tracking for metrics, params, and artifacts  
- ✔️ AWS S3 for model & artifact storage  
- ✔️ Dockerized application for reproducible deployment  
- ✔️ FastAPI for real-time inference and batch CSV predictions  
- ✔️ AWS ECR + EC2 deployment  
- ✔️ Data validation, schema checks, and transformations  
- ✔️ Custom exception handling and logging framework

#### 🧾 How Prediction Works

The FastAPI inference endpoint accepts a CSV file containing website feature values. This design supports batch predictions, enabling you to classify multiple websites at once.

After uploading the CSV and clicking Predict, the API:

1. Applies the saved preprocessing pipeline

2. Runs the trained model on all rows

3. Returns an HTML table that includes:

- Input feature values
- Corresponding predictions (0 = phishing, 1 = legitimate)

You can also download the prediction output.
